            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:178461:11"/>and finally there may bee made as it were a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanye of his Perfections, and Attributes, ſaying vnto him; Graunt mee, o Lord, what I require of thee, for thy owne ſake; for thy Charitye; for thy Mercye; for thy Liberallitye; for thy VViſdome; for thy Omnipotencye; for thy Immenſitye, and Eternitye, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Other Titles there are on the parte of Chriſt IESVS our Lord, true God, and man, to witte; by his Incarnation, and Natiuitye: by his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and Preſentation in the Temple: by his flying into Egipt: by his Faſtings: by his Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Colde, and Nakedneſſe: and by all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Trauell of his Preaching. Againe, by the Dolours, Ignominies, and Torments of his Paſſion, and Deathe; alledging his Sweating of Blood; his Impriſoning; his Scourging; his Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne of Thornes; his Nailing; his Gall, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger; and the reſt: Sometimes ſpeaking to the eternall Father, beſeeching him to heare mee for the Loue of his Sonne; for the Seruices hee did him; and the Paines that for his loue hee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Othertimes ſpeaking to the Sonne of God: alledging vnto him the Loue that hee bare vs, the Office that hee holdeth of our Redeemer, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate; and the greate Price that wee coſt him.

                     <p>Other Titles there are on the parte of our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitye, and Miſerye, alledging before our Lord,

                     <p>VVith theſe 4. Affections wee may ſpeake to our Lord in Praier, to the ende to glorifye him, procuring (as <hi>S.

Theſe Petitions, and Colloquies, may bee made in many formes, according to the diuerſe diſpoſition of him that prayeth, and ſpeaketh to God.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes wee are to ſpeake vnto him as a Sonne ſpeaketh vnto his Father, asking of him all ſuch things as a good Sonne may, and ought to aske of a good Father, with the Spirit of Loue, and Confidence. And in this ſorte wee ſpeake vnto God in that praier of our <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> where Chriſte our Lord declareth what things wee are to aske, as wee shall ſee in the Meditation which shallbee made vpon that praier in the third parte.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes wee are to ſpeake vnto God, as a poore wretche doth to a riche, and mercifull man, begging of him an almes.

                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes wee may ſpeake to God, as a ſicke man ſpeaketh to a Phiſition, declaring vnto him his Infirmityes, and deſiring remedie thereof: or as a man that hath a proceſſe, or one that is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:178461:14"/>guilty ſpeketh to a Iudge, when he informeth him of his right &amp; requireth a fauourable ſentence, or pardon of his Crime. And in this caſe our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquye muſt bee accompanied with Affections of humilliation, of Sorrowe for Sinne, of Purpoſes of ſatisfaction, &amp; amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Of the which wee shall ſee forward many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in the meditations vpon the Miracles, &amp; Parables of our Sauiour Chriſte.</p>
                     <p>Finally other ſometimes wee may ſpeake vnto God with that Spirit that a Scholler ſpeaketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maſter, requiring of him Light, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in ſuch things as wee knowe not. Or as one friende ſpeaketh vnto another, when hee talketh with him of ſome waighty affaire, asking him Counſaile, Direction, and Aide. And if Confidence, and Loue shall ſo farre imbolden vs, our Soule may ſpeake vnto God, as the Bride ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to her Spouſe in ſeuerall Colloquyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the booke of Canticles is replenished.</p>
                     <p>In all theſe ſortes wee may ſpeake to our Lord in praier, clothing ourſelues with the foreſaide affections, ſometimes with one, and ſometimes with another, for all are fitting vnto vs with our God, who is our Phiſition, our Iudge, our Frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and the Spouſe of our Soules. Truth it is, that the greateſt certainety in theſe Petitions, &amp; Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquyes, dependeth principally vpon the holy Spirit,
<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaide, that Deuotion is the Tongue of the Soule, which whoſoeuer hath, is very skilfull in talking, and reaſoning with the eternall VVorde. But this notwithſtanding wee for our parte muſt aide ourſelues, and learne to

                     <p>VVhereunto I adde, that albeit Praier is properly a ſpeeche, &amp; Colloquy with our Lord, wee may not withſtanding ſpeake therein to ourſelues, &amp; haue conference with our owne Soule. Sometimes, our ſelues (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaieth) exhorting ourſelues,

                     <p>In this ſorte <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpake many times to his Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, ſaying: O my Soule, why arte thou ſorrowfull?

From theſe Colloquyes wee muſt make a ſtep to ſpeake to God himſelfe, as did the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Sonne, when hee ſpake to himſelfe ſaying: <hi>Hovv many of my Fathers hirelings haue abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of breade, and I heere periſh for famine?</hi>

                     <p>Finally wee may likewiſe in Praier ſpeake to our bleſſed Lady the Virgin, to the Angells, and Saintes for the ſame forſaid two endes; either to praiſe, and bleſſe them for their Sanctitye, &amp; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and for the benefits which they doe vs; or to require them to aide, and fauour vs in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our Saluation. For the which wee may li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe alledge vnto them, ſome of thoſe Titles which we laid downe in the precedent §. &amp; other ſpeciall ones beſeeming eche of them. To the moſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:178461:15"/>ſacred Virgin may bee alledged, that shee is our mother, and the Aduocatrice of Sinners, and that for our remedie her Sonne gaue her this Office in charge: alledging alſo the Loue that shee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, and her deſire that all should loue, and ſerue him, beſeeching her to doe for vs the office of a mother, and an Aduocatrice, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate vnto vs, that, her Loue, and Deſire, in obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for vs what wee requeſt, that wee may the better ſerue him whome shee ſo dearely loueth. Alſo to our Angell Gardian may bee alledged, that hee comply with the Office hee holdeth, to preſent our praiers vnto God, and to procure a good diſpatche of them: and that his honour is intereſſed in our beeing good, and hauing a happy iſſue of our pretention of Heauen: and that ſeeing the Deuill ſleepeth not to tempt vs, that hee ſleepe not, but bee watchfull to defende vs. After this ſorte wee may ſpeake to the reſt of the Sainctes, that shall offer themſelues in the matter of meditation, or to whome wee are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted, rather to ſtirre vp deuotion in ourſelues, then to moue them thereby: for as they loue vs, and deſire our Saluation, they are very much inclined to ſollicite it.</p>

                     <p>Finally thoſe which arriue to the Eſtate of Perfection, walking in <hi>the Vnitiue vvaye,</hi> haue two other pathes to attaine to the perfect Vnion of Loue.

The other way is, by contemplating the myſteries of the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye, and Trinitye of God, his Perfections, and Benefits, whereof the ſixt parte entreateth. And theſe two laſt partes are moſt proper to ſuch, as are perfect, according to the ſaying of <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 103. Pſalme.

                     <p>By what hath beene ſaied it enſueth, that the meditations of theſe ſixe partes are as the ſixe wings of the Seraphins which God hath vpon Earthe,

                     <p>Beſides this Experience teacheth, that when a greate Spirit or Affection of any Vertue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, is predominant in a Soule, vpon what thing ſoeuer it meditateth, it taketh occaſion to feede, and augment it.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:178461:19"/>of Humillitye. And if in his Hearte the Spirite of Loue doe predominate, though hee meditate vpon Iudgement, and Hell, hee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all into the Affections of Loue.

                     <p>From hence it is, that albeit by the ordinary Lawe wee are to obſerue the Order propounded, yet neede wee not to bee ſo tied to it, that it shall not bee lawfull to change it: nay rather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is conuenient, for ſome cannot applye themſelues to Conſiderations of Feare, who yet are eaſily moued with meditations of Loue; and other contrarily. Some finde Deuotion, and Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in conſidering the miſteries of the Childehood of our Sauiour Chriſte: others in conſidering the myſteries of his Paſſion: ſome in one myſterie, and ſome in another: and it is not good to force them ouermuch, nor to drawe them from their conſideration, to paſſe them to another, wherein they shall not finde what they deſired. And for this cauſe our Lord hath prouided the matter of meditation to bee ſo copious, and ample, that euery one may finde ſome that is fitting to his Purpoſe.</p>

And contrarily thoſe that are very Imaginatiue, are to bee very well aduiſed, becauſe their vehement Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may bee vnto them an occaſion of many Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, ſuppoſing their Imagination to bee reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, &amp; that the Image which they forme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelues, is the ſame thing which they Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: And ſo thorough their indiſcretion they vſe to breake their heade, and conuert to their hinderaunce that, which taken with moderation, might haue beene to their proffit.</p>

This (as S. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauenture</hi> aduertiſeth) may bee practized in twoe manners. The one is, euery one compoſing the wordes as his neceſſity, or Deuotion shall dictate vnto him, not ſtanding vpon this, whither they bee well, or ill ordered: for our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth rather the agreement of the Hearte, and the feruour of the Affections, then of the VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and hee is better appeaſed with the rude ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the ſtammering Childe, and penitent Sinner, then with the well compoſed wordes of a Learned man that is prowde.</p>
                     <p>The other manner is, ſaying ſome Praier made by another, as are thoſe of the Churche, or of ſome Saincte, appropriating them to himſelfe, and ſpeaking them with ſuch feeling, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as if hee himſelfe were compoſing them; after that manner which in the 9. §. wee shall preſcribe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for our <hi>Corporall ſenſes,</hi> there can bee no certaine rule giuen: for ſome finde themſelues beſt, holding their eyes shut; others helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with opening them, looking vp to Heauen, or beholding ſome Image. Some are troubled with the hearing of any thing: others are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:178461:26"/>with hearing ſome Song, or Muſicke of the Churche: Some feele deuotion with ſtriking themſelues often on the breſt, as <hi>S.

                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, I am to examine whither I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the aduertiſements of thoſe things that are precedent to Praier: as whither I premeditated the matter of the meditation; whither I put my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:178461:27"/>well in the preſence of God: whither I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto him this Action in Spirit, and what puritye of Intention I had therein, with ſuch like: being very ſorrowfull for any defect that I shall finde, and purpoſing from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to amende it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, I am to examine whither I were attentiue, or diſtracted: whither deuoute, or drye: whither I contented myſelfe with diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing onely (for that were no Praier, but ſtudye) or whither I had good affections, and purpoſes: whither I begged of God, and ſpake vnto him in my Colloquies with reuerence, and confidence, or without it. And if I finde that it hath gonne well with mee in all. I will giue thankes to God for it, attributing this good ſucceſſe not to my diligence, but to his grace, and mercye. But if I finde that it hath gonne ill with mee, I will examine the cauſe whither it were any fault of mine, or any paſſion, or diſordered Affection, or any negligence, or remiſſeneſſe: and being ſorrie for my fault I will purpoſe to amende with determination to mortify my ſelfe, and to remooue away the cauſe of this harme.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I am to examine the motions, and Inſpirations, or Illuminations, and ſpirituall Taſte that I haue felt, marking well what effectes they haue wrought in mee, to knowe whither they ſpring from a good Spirit, or not, and to gaine experience that may helpe mee to knowe the Variety of Spirits.

                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, I am to examine the Reſolutions that I made in Praier, to ſee when, and how I am to put them in execution: and generally, I am to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:178461:27"/>examine what fruite I drawe from Praier, and Conuerſation with God: for if my Praier bee a Tree without fruite,
<note place="margin">

                     <p>Herein the Seraphicall Doctor <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> was very excellent, in his very many, and large treatiſes that hee made of theſe matters: and no leſſe was our glorious <hi>Father Ignatius,</hi> couching in his litle booke, not onely variety of matter for meditation, but alſo ſeuerall formes of praying, for the examination of the Conſcience; for the application of the Interiour Senſes of the Soule, and for diuerſe Similitudes, and Parables: and eſpecially hee taught three very proffitable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Praier, accomodated to thoſe which walke in the three wayes aboue-ſaide, <hi>Purgatiue, Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatiue,</hi> and <hi>Vnitiue,</hi> although they are all three of greate profit for them all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt forme of Praying, is vpon Gods Commaundements; vpon the ſeuen Capitall Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, commonly called the ſeuen deadely Sinnes:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:178461:28"/>vpon the three faculties of the Soule, and vpon the fiue Senſes: taking all this for matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and Praier. This forme is proper to thoſe that walke in the <hi>Purgatiue</hi> waye, labouring to cleanſe themſelues of their Sinnes. And ſo wee will declare this forme in the firſt parte, making ſpeciall meditations of all theſe things, with the reſt that pertaine to the manner of praying, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Conſcience, and preparing a mans ſelfe for Confeſſion, and Communion, whereby is obtained the puritye of the Soule.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond forme of Praying, is vpon VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, taking for matter of meditation ſome Pſalme of Dauid; or ſome Sermon, or Sentence of our Sauiour Chriſte; or ſome Praier, or Hymne of the Churche, ruminating euery worde by it ſelfe, and drawing out the Spirit, and Affection that is in it. For as the wordes of holy Scripture were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated by the holy Spirit, they haue all ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye worthy of Ponderation. And as the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is gouerned by the ſame holy Spirit, it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a worde, but it containeth much Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The forme of meditating theſe, is to conſider who ſpeaketh that worde; to whome it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or directed: to what ende: with what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Spirit it was ſpoken; and what is the ſignification thereof: that is to ſay, what it is that it commaundeth, or counſelleth, threateneth, or promiſeth, or what it is that is required, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended therein, drawing out of all, Affections agreeing with what hath beene pondered.</p>
                     <p>For in another ſorte are thoſe wordes to bee meditated which God ſpeaketh to man, then thoſe which man ſpeaketh to God: The firſt, as a man that heareth God, who is his Maſter, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer, Counſellor, Protector, and Rewarder; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him with Deſire to learne what hee teacheth,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:178461:29"/>to execute what hee commaundeth, to followe what hee counſelleth, to feare what hee threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, to hope for what hee promiſeth, and to loue him for what hee ſayeth.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond are to bee ruminated with that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with which hee that ordained them ſpake them, &amp; according to the ende whereunto they are directed. The which is manifeſtly ſeene in the Pſalmes of <hi>David:</hi> for ſome hee made with a Spirit of praiſing God, and thanking him for the benefits which hee had donne to his Soule, and to his People: Some with a ſpirit of Contrition, to aske him pardon of his Sinnes: and other ſome with a ſpirit of Affliction, joyned with greate Confidence to Implore his ayde in Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. And therefore to ruminate them, or to ſay them with proffit, wee muſt clothe ourſelues (as <hi>Caſsianus</hi> aduertiſeth) with the ſame ſpirit wherewith they were ſpoken,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Collat.</hi> 10 <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> as if wee ourſelues had made them to the ſame ende.</p>
                     <p>And euen Experience teacheth vs, that hee that feeleth himſelfe cheerefull for the benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from God, ſayeth with Deuotion the Pſalmes of Ioy, as are: <hi>Benedic anima mea Domino: &amp; omnia quae intra me ſunt nomini ſancto eius, &amp;c. Laudate Dominum de caelis, &amp;c.</hi> And at ſuch time hee findeth not ſo much juice in the Pſalme of <hi>Miſerere mei Deus.</hi> And contrarily, hee that is afflicted with his Sinnes, ſayeth with Deuotion the Pſalme of <hi>Miſerere mei,</hi> and applyeth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe then to the Pſalmes of Ioye. VVhich wee are to conſider, that wee may chooſe for matter of meditation thoſe wordes, and Praiers, which accord with that Spirit which wee feele, and with the ende that wee pretende.</p>
                     <p>This ſecond forme of Praying is moſt proper to thoſe that walke in the <hi>Illuminatiue</hi> way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:178461:29"/>the knowledge, and Vnderſtanding of the Verities of Faithe ſo to encreaſe in Spirit; and of this wee will ſet downe the practiſe in the ſecond, and third parte, meditating in this ſorte vpon the Salutation of the Angell: vpon the Song of the Virgin; vpon the Praier of the <hi>Pater noſter;</hi> and vpon certaine Sentences, and Praiers of our Lord Chriſte; vpon whoſe wordes wee will alwaies me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dltate with more attention, becauſe as the Spouſe ſaide, <hi>His Lippes are distilling the firſt Mirrhe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 6.68. <hi>Ibidem.</hi> 63.</note> that is, they teache moſt excellent Vertue, the firſt, and moſt ſurpaſſing of all other: and (as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaide) His wordes are the VVordes of eternall life; and our Lord himſelfe ſaieth; That his wordes were Spirit, &amp; Life. And therefore whoſoeuer meditateth them, as is fitting, hee shall drawe out aboundance of Spirit, and moſt pure life of Grace, by the which hee may bee worthy of life euerlaſting.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third forme of Praying, is, by way of Aſpirations, and Affections, which aunſwere to the reſpirations of the bodye, procuring that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Reſpiration, and Reſpiration, there may breathe out from the inward parte of our Soule, ſome holy Affection, or ſome Groning of the Spirit, or ſome short Praier of thoſe which wee call Iaculatorye, ſpending the whole time, that is betweene one reſpiration and another, in the Pondering, or Vnderſtanding, and Spirituall Taſte of what wee deſire, or aske: or of the thing for the which wee grone, and ſigh vnto God. This forme is moſt accomodated to thoſe that walke in the <hi>Vnitiue</hi> waye, aſpiring, and thirſting for Actuall Vnion with God, and with this deſire they labour to pray with the greateſt continuation, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencye that they can: for Praier is as neceſſarye for the perfect ſpirituall life of the Soule, as reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is for the life of the Bodye, according to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:178461:30"/>that of <hi>Dauid</hi> which ſayeth:

And now ſeeing this is not poſſible thorough our Imbecillitye, they take at certaine times ſome ſpace for this exercize, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting in this forte the Iaculatory Praiers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof wee will preſently ſpeake, caſting them vp to Heauen like Dartes, or Arrowes which are shotte from the Hearte, as from a Bowe with vehement Affection of Loue.</p>

Viewe of the eternall Veritye, without variety of Diſcourſes, penetrating it with the Light of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, with greate Affections of Admiration, and Loue; vnto the which ordinarily no man arriueth, but by much exercize of meditation, &amp; diſcourſe. In ſuch manner as a VVoman when shee intendeth to marrye with a man, ſpendeth many daies in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:178461:30"/>and certifying her ſelfe what hee is, Inquiring of his linage, wealthe, Condition, Healthe, Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitye, Diſcretion, Vertue, and other partes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, and thinking much vpon them, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to bee to her liking, shee is content to loue him, and takes him for her Spouſe: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes when she hath knowen him, and taken him for her Husband, shee needeth make no newe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, but with onely ſeeing him, or remembring him, or hearing his name, she loueth him, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to giue him Content, and to bee allwayes in his Companye. The like paſſeth with a Scholler that would make choiſe of ſome newe maſter: or with a Seruaunt that intendeth to take a newe Lorde; or with one freinde that deſireth to make a newe, and ſtrict league of Freindship with another. Euen in like ſorte Principiants in Vertue, &amp; in the Exerciſe of Praier, had neede to ſpende much time in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Diſcourſes, inquiring what, and who God is: who is Chriſte our Sauiour, his perfections, and Vertues, and his meruailous workes, mouing themſelues with theſe Conſiderations to loue him, and to take him for their maſter, for their Lorde, for their freinde, and Spouſe of their Soules. But after they are much exerciſed, and practized herein, it hapneth oftentimes that a ſingle viewe, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of God without newe diſcourſes, is enough to inflame them in his Loue, and in the other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions aforeſaide.

True it is, that as our Vnderſtanding layeth not much holde on things that it perceiueth not with the Senſes, it eaſily looſeth the eſtimation of ſpirituall, and diuine things, and forgetteth them,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:178461:31"/>and ſo hath neede often to renewe thoſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and Diſcourſes which it made at the firſt; for otherwiſe it will finde itſelfe much diſtracted, and drye, vnleſſe it bee when as our Lord by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour, will without them giue light, and knowledge enough, to inkindle the Affections of Loue, communicating the grace of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>By what hath beene ſaide, I inferre for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſome Perſons that are deſirous to vſe Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Praier, and yet for want of healthe, or ſome other cauſe, dare not diſcourſe, nor diue to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of that which is incloſed within the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Faithe, that they diſpaire not of the Principall contained in this ſoueraigne exerciſe, for to ſuch, God vſeth to graunt vnder the title of their Neceſſity, or Infirmitye, what hee giueth vnto others vnder the title of many Seruices, and large meditations wherein they haue beene exercized. For as hee is ſo liberall, and eaſily contended, hee asketh of no man more, then what according to his portion hee can giue him, ſupplying that which wanteth,
<note place="margin">The epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Mentall Praier.</note> with his diuine Illuſtrations. Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought therefore to bee aduertized, that the ende of all the meditations, and Diſcourſes that shallbee put in the ſixe partes of this Booke, is to attaine to three notions, or knowledges. One of himſelfe, and of his innumerable neceſſities, and miſeries of Bodye, and Soule: The other of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte IESVS our Lord, true God, and man, and of his excellent Vertues, eſpecially thoſe which were reſplendent in his Natiuitye, Paſſion, and Deathe. And the third of God Trine, and One, and of his infinite perfections and benefits, as well naturall, as ſupernaturall that procede from him. Theſe three knowledges goe linked one with another, entring, and iſſuing from one to another, aſcending from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:178461:31"/>himſelfe, and from Chriſte to God, and deſcending from God to Chriſte, and to himſelfe:

                     <p>Some Affections be with himſelfe, confounding himſelfe for his Sinnes, and want of zeale, beeing exceeding ſorrowfull for them, purpoſing amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and humbling himſelfe, for that in ſteede of fruite, hee hath brought forth nothing but Sinne. Others be with Chriſte our Lorde, compaſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Afflictions, rejoicing in his Vertues, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring therein to Imitate him, and requiring his grace to that ende. Others be with God our Lord, admiring at his Greateneſſe, praiſing him therefore, giuing him thankes for the benefits hee hath donne vs, and offering ourſelues very really to ſerue him for the ſame; mingling herewith all Petitions of celeſtiall Graces, and guiftes, for himſelfe, and for the whole Churche, and for other his neighbours, particularizing thoſe things whereof hee hath greateſt neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>This preſuppoſed, any Perſon whatſoeuer deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to vſe Mentall Praier, how weake ſoeuer hee bee, may put himſelfe in the preſence of the Liuing God, whome hee hath neere him, and within him, and renewing the notice which hee hath by Faithe of the three things aforeſaide, may quietly exerciſe the Affections correſpondent vnto then. Sometimes confeſſing to God, all his miſeries one by one, with Affections of Dolour, &amp; Humilliation, &amp; deſiring remedye of them. Sometimes calling to memorye the Vertues reſplendent in ſome miſterye of Chriſte our Lord, his Humillitye, Obedience, and Patience, with Affections and Deſires to Imitate them. Other times recounting the benefits that hee hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, with affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Thankeſgiuing; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:178461:32"/>the infinite perfections of God, his Boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, Mercie, &amp; Prouidence, with Affections of Praier, and Ioye.

                        </gap> more, ſpending them all in theſe meditations, and exerciſes, which may bee donne for diuerſe endes, and vpon diuerſe Occaſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> when one is heauy loden with Sinnes, and deſireth to make a true Confeſſion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conuerſion, it is an admirable meanes to with drawe a mans ſelfe for ſome eight dayes, or more, to ſome retired place, ſpending all that time in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon his Sinnes, and in meditations that may mooue to ſorrow for them, and to make a very perfect chaunge of Life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when any one deſireth to learne this myſticall Science of the Spirit to knowe how to pray mentally, and to conuerſe with God, and to gaine heerein ſome vſe, and experience; It is good to dedicate a moneth, or two to this exerciſe, vntill hee prooue well Induſtriated. For albeit that the principall maſter of this Science is God, yet it is alſo a helpe to haue a viſible Tutour that may direct him, and to take time to learne, and practiſe what hee shall teache.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> occaſion is, when one deſires to take
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:178461:37"/>ſome Eſtate of Life, and doubteth which were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for him to take for his Saluation, &amp; perfection: or when hee deſireth to begin any greate enterpriſe in the ſeruice of God, and ſtandes in doubt of our Lordes will, &amp; Pleaſure; or if he be aſſured thereof, deſireth to enter with good footing, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe with Praier, negotiating Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to haue good ſucceſſe therein. In ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is very conuenient to take ſome time of retiredneſſe;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Math.</hi> 4.2.</note> as Chriſte our Lord before hee began to preache, retired himſelfe fortye dayes in the deſert.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourth</hi> occaſion is, when thoſe that vſe this mentall Praier, perceiue themſelues key colde, diſtracted, and drye therein, and withall finde themſelues very ſlacke in matters of Diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. In theſe caſes, the moſt effectuall meanes to renewe themſelues, and to reenter into feruour, is to dedicate eight dayes to theſe meditations, ſpending therein the greateſt parte of the day: and becauſe this ſlackeneſſe ordinariely entreth by litle, and litte into all, it is good once euery yeare to recollect a mans ſelfe ſome eight dayes to this ende.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finally</hi> allbeeit a man finde no ſlackeneſſe, yet it is good now and then, to giue himſelfe a ſacietie, and fullneſſe of God, to increaſe in his Loue, and to excell the more in his ſeruice, as many Sainctes were accuſtomed to doe, who by this meanes attained to very high degrees of Sanctitye.</p>
                     <p>As for the Ordinary time, there can no generall rule bee giuen for all: for this time muſt bee meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the healthe, &amp; habilitie, with the State, and Office, and with the neceſſary Obligations, &amp; Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations of euery man.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:178461:38"/>without beeing wanting to the things aboue-ſaide, the better it is.

                     <p>Concerning this ordinary time, wee muſt bee very conſiderate, that after a man hath ſet downe his time that hee intendeth to imploye euery day in Praier; bee it for the rule of his Eſtate, as ſome Religious doe; or by ſpeciall Deuotion, or Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his ghoſtly Fathers, hee muſt bee very conſtant in ſpending that whole time intirely in his holy exerciſe, without letting ſlippe one onely daye, or looſing one onely Credo time of the hower: for the Diuell with greate ſolicitude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth a thouſand occaſions, ſometimes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall excuſes; and ſometimes of Cares, and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnder the title of Pietie, to make vs to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our Praier: for omitting it one daye through Slothe, or through any other wreſted ende, a man comes to omitte it afterwardes another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daye,

                           <hi>Daniel.</hi> 6.10.</note> who was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to pray three times a Day, and albeeit the king of Perſia commaunded, that no man vpon paine of his life should pray to God in thirty dayes, yet hee would not omitte his accuſtomed Praier: <hi>Ne tantillum quidem temporis ſuſtinuit ab orando ceſſare;</hi> He did not ſo much as for a very litle time ceaſe to praye: for hee vnderſtood that his ſpirituall life depended vpon Praier, and for feare of the deathe of the Bodye, hee would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the life of his Soule, which (ſaith <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>) is as deade when it wanteth Praier, as the Bodye is deade, when it is abandoned by the Soule. And as <hi>Daniel</hi> although by occaſion of Praying, liee put himſelfe in daunger of Deathe, for hee was caſt into the Lyons den, yet in effect hee died not: for God deliuered him from that Daunger, shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Mouthes of the Lyons, becauſe hee opened his mouthe to praye. So alſo wee may beleeue that for accomplishing the taske of our Praier, wee shall looſe neither life, nor healthe, nor content, nor the good diſpatche of other buſineſſes: nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the meanes of Praier, we ſo diſpoſe ourſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues that God may take them to his charge, &amp; doe with his Omnipotencie, and VViſdome, what wee ourſelues are not able to doe by reaſon of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitye, and Ignoraunce.

                        <p>THe firſt Pointe is, to call to <hi>minde</hi> the Sinne of the <hi>Angells,</hi> who were created by God in the Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Heauen, replenished with VViſdome, &amp; Grace: but abuſing their Frewill they grewe prowd againſt their Creator, for the which they were throwne out of Heauen, &amp; caſt into Hell, looſing for euer the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, &amp; bleſſedneſſe for the which they were created. 1. Vpon this Veritie taught vs by the Catholike Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, I may diſcourſe, pondering three things: Firſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:178461:49"/>how Liberal God was to the Angells creating them according to his owne Image, &amp; Likeneſſe, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating vnto them without any merit of theirs, moſt excellent giftes of Nature, &amp; Grace. By reaſon whereof wee may ſay of all, as was ſayed of one, That they were adorned with nine Stones very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; that is, with nine Excellencies, which <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ezech.</hi> 28.13.</note> &amp; the reſt receiued in their Creation. For God made them Pure Spirits, without mixture of Bodye: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, without feare of Corruption: Intellectual, with greate Delicacye of VVitte: Free, that nothing could force their VVill: VViſe, with fulneſſe of all naturall Sciences: Powerfull, aboue all Inferiour Creatures: Holy, with the giftes of Grace, Charitye, &amp; the reſt of the Vertues: Inhabitants of the Paradiſe of Delightes, which is the Empyreal Heauen. And finally, Capable of ſeeing God clearely with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this Glorye if they perſeuered in his Seruice: which they might eaſily doe, &amp; were obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Lawe of Gratitude for theſe 9. Titles.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, I will conſider, how Ingratefull ſome of them were againſt God, growing arrogant with theſe giftes, &amp; arming themſelues with them againſt him of whome they had receaued them, not giuing him that Reuerence, and Obedience which they ought to haue giuen him with Humilitie; but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their Libertie, &amp; Forces to offend him who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for ſo many Titles they ought to haue ſerued.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I will ponder, how terrible God shewed himſelfe to chaſtize them preſently, without giuing them time of Repentance, depriuing them, for that onely Sinne, of thoſe giftes of Grace which hee had giuen them,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.18.</note> &amp; throwing them like Lightening from Heauen, to the euerlaſting fiers of Hell, without reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect either to the beautie of their nature, or to the greateneſſe of their Eſtate; or that they were his Creatures made according to his Image, and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: or that they were exceeding wiſe; or that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:178461:50"/>they had beene his freindes: for one mortall Sinne onely is ſufficient to obſcure all this, and is worthy of ſo terrible punishement:
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2 4.</note> which (<hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaithe) Gods Iuſtice permitted, and ordained for our Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For if hee ſpared not the Angells ſinning, but tyed with rhe ropes of their Sinne, threwe them vnto Hell to bee there tormented, although they were ſo noble: how much leſſe will hee omitte to punishe men obſtinate in their Tranſgreſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo baſe?
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2 11.</note> And if the Angells <hi>Fortitudine, &amp; Virtuce maiores non portant aduerſum ſe execrabile iudicium, vvho are greater then men in strength, and povver beare not the execrable Iudgement againſt them,</hi> but with greate raging, and Impatiencie; how much leſſe shall feeble,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ad Hebr.</hi> 10.31.</note> and wretched men bee able to endure it? O how horrible a thing it is to fall into the handes of the liuing God, handes ſo heauye, that the Angells themſelues cannot ſuffer them!</p>
                        <p>Theſe three things I am to applye to myſelfe pondering how liberall God hath beene towardes mee, doing mee innumerable Benefits: and how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull I haue beene to him, committing innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Sinnes; and how I haue deſerued that God should punishe mee as hee did the Angells, yea, and much more: for their Sinne was but one, mine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: theirs was but a Sinne of Thought onely in matter of Pride; mine both of Thought, VVorde, and Deede in matter of Pride, of Luxury, of VVra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, and of other Vices: theirs was not Injurious to the bloud of IESVS Chriſte, for it was not shed for them, mine are Injurious againſt this bloud of the Sonne of God, which was shed for mee on the Croſſe. Then this beeing ſo, how Iuſt a thing were it, that God should haue ſuncke mee into Hell in the Company of the Deuills, making mee partaker of their paines, ſeeing I would needes bee ſo of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:178461:50"/>their Sinnes? <hi>O God of Vengeance, hovv is it that thou hast not reuenged thyſelfe on a man ſo vvicked as I? Hovv hast thou ſuffred mee ſo long time? VVho hath vvithhelde the rigour of thy Iustice, that it ſhould not puniſh him, that hath deſerued ſo terrible puniſhment? O my Soule, hovv is it, that thou doeſt not feare, and tremble, conſidering the dreadefull Iudgement of God againſt his Angells? If vvith ſo greate ſeueritye hee puniſhed Creatures ſo noble, vvhy ſhould not ſo vile, and miſerable a Creature as thou, feare the like Puniſhment? O moſt povverfull Creator, ſeeing thou hast ſhevved thyſelfe to mee not a God of Vengeance, but a Father of Mercye, continue tovvardes mee thy Mercye, pardonning my Sinnes; and deliuering mee from Hell, vvhich for them I haue deſerued.</hi>

So that neither the ten plagues of Egipt, nor the fier of Sodome, nor the Tribulations of vnhappy Ieruſalem, nor the paines that Sinners, Rebells to God, doe ſuffer heere, are put in account to lighten the Chaſtizements of Hell, which shallbee as greate, as if heere they had ſuffered no others at all.

                        <p n="4">4.

                        <p>THe third Propertye of Deathe, is, that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth but once, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul:</hi>

Out of all this I will collect greate confuſion, and shame for my vanitye, and Senſuallitye wherewith I deſire curiouſneſſe of apparell, ſofteneſſe of bed, and wideneſſe of habitation, animating myſelfe to mortifye my ſuperfluities heerein, and to beare patiently whatſoeuer wantes, ſeeing what I now haue, how litle ſoeuer it bee, is very much,

<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.21</note> for if I came naked out of my mothers wombe, &amp; am naked to returne againe, it is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te matter to liue naked in this ſorte, conforming the midle of the life, to the entrance, &amp; egreſſe thereof. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will Imitate Deathe in the renuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fall thoſe ſenſuall Pleaſures, whereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chaſtitie obligeth mee: So that as in Deathe matrimonies are diſſolued: the care of wife, children, and familye ceaſeth, and there is made a generall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce of all earthly things, and of the delightes of the fleshe: So I with the vowe of Chaſtitie, shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to bee as it were deade to all theſe things, and to the cares thereof, as if there were none in the worlde for mee, or I were not aliue for them.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to promiſe to myſelfe many yeares of Life, and to beethinke mee what I shall doe with them, as if this depended onely vpon my VVill, and not vpon Gods: who peraduenture hath determined to take from vs our Life the very ſame night, or day, wherein wee thought it should haue beene largeſt: And herewith hee defeateth our Imaginations, and diſcouereth how much they went aſtraye. VVhereupon I will reprehende my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the wordes of the Apoſtle S.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The <hi>ſecond</hi> Deceite is, to promiſe to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:178461:88"/>not onely long life, but alſo to aſſure myſeffe that I shall haue healthe, ſtrength, and content with all the goods that I poſſeſſe, and that they alſo shall laſt as long as I: from whence it proceedeth that hereupon I exhort my Soule ſaying; <hi>Requieſce; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede, bibe, &amp; epulare,</hi> Take thy reſt, eate, drinke, and make good cheere, giue thyſelfe to banquetting and Pleaſure, for thou shallt want nothing.

The <hi>third</hi> Deceite is, to forget to prouide what is neceſſarye for the other life, as if there were no more but this preſent. And this was the moſt quallified folly of this riche man, that hauing prouided his Soule of ſo much wealthe to paſſe this temporall life, hee was alltogither obliuious to prouide it of thoſe neceſſarye goods for life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: for the which it muſt needes bee, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Soule that in this miſerable life, did eate, drinke, and banquet, muſt afterwardes endure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Hunger, and Thirſt, and eternall miſerye.</p>

                        <p>Adde to this, the moſt painefull imagination, that perforce, &amp; in deſpight of them, they shall bee eternally togither, not being able to flye or diuide themſelues one from another.

Inſomuch that Chriſte our lorde when hee deſcended into Hell, entred not into this place, nor gaue them any comfort. VVhat, will Princes then thinke, to ſee themſelues conſorted with Plebeyans, and entreated by them with ſuch inſolencie, and hatred? what a torment will it bee to liue perforce with my enemyes that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually abhorre mee, and curſe mee, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing able either to ſtoppe their mouthes, or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne owne eares? what a paine will it bee neuer to ſee perſon that wisheth mee well, nor is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsionate of my miſeries, but that rather encre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſeth them?

Theſecond waye is, by that which the damned themſelues feele by wanting this high felicitye, not in ſo much, as it is an honeſt Good, for they neither loue God, nor any holy thing: But for ſo much, as they want that which should gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue them high, and eternall reſt, and free them from ſo horrible a torment. This I may come to find out by ſome likeneſſe of things of this life: For if men haue ſo much feeling to bee depriued of an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, wherevnto they had ſome right, how much more shall they feele to bee depriued of the eternall inheritance of heauen, to which they might haue had right, if they had not forfeited it thorough ſinne? And if the priuation of finite, and limited goods, and delightes doth ſo much grieue the hearte, how much more will it bee grieued with the priuation of an infinite Good, wherein are eminently comprehended all the goods, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures created? And if among terrible things, deathe is the moſt terrible, becauſe it diuideth the ſoule from the bodye, and from this viſible worlde: how much more terrible shall eternall deathe bee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein the ſoule is diuided from God, from his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and from the inuiſible worlde? And as <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The moſt ordinary are to abhorre my neighbour becauſe his Proſperitie maketh mee ſad: to reioyce at his fall, to grieue at his exalting: to heare his praiſe with paine, and his diſpraiſe with delight: to murmur at him and his affaires, procuring to drowne, and vnder-value them, and vſing meanes to attaine to this ende.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. From hence I will aſcende, to ponder the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall benedictions, which God giueth to thoſe that keepe his lawe, in the keeping whereof, hee hath with greate excellencye included three kindes of good: to witte, honeſt good, proffitable good, and delectable good,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 18.8.</note> of the which <hi>Dauid</hi> in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Pſalme maketh another sweete catalogue. For firſt the law of God is moſt pure, and moſt holy, conuerting ſoules, replenishing them with wiſdome, and all vertues. It is alſo moſt proffitable to obtaine all good that may bee deſired, not onely for the ſoule but for the bodye, as healthe,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:178461:146"/>by all the ſweet things of this life. From hence it is, that God preuenteth principiants with the benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of delight,

To thoſe which are proficients, this diuine lawgiuer giueth his benedie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they may encreaſe from vertue to vertue, vntill they arriue to the height of perfection.

                        <p>Conſidering theſe bleſsings, and comparing them with the curſes which in the precedent pointe were declared, I am principally to collect three affections of very much importance. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is agreate <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovve</hi> for hauing infringed a lawe ſo holy, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and ſo ſweete, making myſelfe vnworthy of its celeſtiall benedictions, &amp; incurring the three euils contrarie to the three goods that haue beene ſpoken of: for togither with the breache of the lawe marche thoſe vices that pollute both bodie, and ſpirit; all the temporall, and eternall hurtes, that bodie and ſoule doe ſuffer: and all the heauineſſes, and bitterneſſes wherewith our heart is afflicted.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The <hi>Second</hi> affection is of <hi>Confidence,</hi> aſſuredly hoping that if I obſerue the lawe of God, I shall obtaine the bleſſings that hee promiſeth mee, calling to mindethoſe memorable wordes of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> who ſaieth, <hi>Homo ſenſatus credit legi, &amp; lex illi fidelis,</hi> The wiſe man beleiueth the lawe of God,

                              <hi>Eccl.</hi> 33.4.</note> and the lawe is faithfull vnto him: which is to ſay. The iuſt man, and the lawe are faithfull one to another.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:178461:146"/>The iuſt is faithfull in obeying the lawe, and the lawe is faithfull in rewarding the iuſt. It defendeth him in perills: It comforteth him in his aduerſities: it directeth him in his proſperities: it counſelleth him in his doubtes: it fauoureth him in his buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: it maketh his praiers to bee hearde; it aideth him in life: it protecteth him in deathe: and finally it croweneth him in glorie.

The 7. is of admirable fortitude, ourſelues vanquishing ourſelues, and the vehement inclination that men haue to couer their ſinnes, to defende, and excuſe them, like <hi>Adam,</hi> from whome all men doe inherite it.

                        <p n="2">2.

His mercie, in pardoning the moſt terrible paine that was perpetuallie to continue, and his iuſtice in requiring ſatisfaction, with another lighter paine that continueth but a while.

                        <p>SEcondly, I am to conſider, what a greate feeling thoſe ſoules haue, and mine shall haue of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie, and darkneſſe of that priſon, which is to want the ſight of God, and what a terrible paine this is, like to that which they call the <hi>paine of loſſe,</hi> pondering the cauſes of this ſence and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p n="2">2. The 2. cauſe is, for that the loue of God is there

Deſire vvith greate feruency to goe to beholde him, remoouing from thee all that may deferre the accomplishment of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: that vvith the ende of thy life, there may bee an ende of thy paine, and that thou mayeſt preſentely enter into rest, and gloris.

                        <p>THirdly, I am to conſider the paine which they call of ſence, which my ſoule shall ſuffer in Purgatorye, tormented by the terrible fier thereof.</p>
                        <p>This is to bee pondered, firſt, for that this fier is the ſame with that of Hell, in compariſon whereof that of this life, is as it were painted: As alſo, for that it wonderfully tormenteth, as beeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God, and of a wrathfull God, whoſe hande is exceeding heauye when hee reuengeth his iniurye. For as the fier melteth the ſiluer, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie it from droſſe: ſo this fier as the Prophet ſaieth,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:178461:182"/>to purifie them from the droſſe they brought from the worlde. So that whileſt there is any thing to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie,

And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon holy men conclude, that the dolours of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie exceede in that which is paine, and torment, the dolours that ſinners endure in this life: and thoſe which martirs haue ſuſtained: yea, and thoſe that the king of martirs himſelfe, Chriſte Ieſus our Lord did ſuffer, to whome I am humbly to ſay, <hi>O most ſvveete redeemer, chastize mee not in thy fury vvith the fier of hell: and purifie mee ſo in this life, that I may haue no neede of the fier of purgatorie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From this conſideration I am to collect three af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and Intentions of very much Importance. The 1. is a greate Feare of God, and of the rigour of his Iuſtice. For if I conſider it well, what neede I bee ſo much amazed that the maieſtie of God, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des beholding the ſoules burne in hell without hauing compaſſion of them, ſeeing they are his enemies, and perſiſt in abhoring him: as that his should ſee thoſe of Purgatory burne, enduring moſt terrible paines, and ſometimes for very light ſinnes: and yet louing them much, and beeing beloued of them, hee letteth them burne, and bee in paine vntill they pay all that they owe?
<note place="margin">Colloquie</note> 
                           <hi>VVho ſhall not feare thee, o king of the nations? If thou thus burnest the fruitefull tree for a fevve thornes that vvere min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, vvith the good fruite: hovv vviltt thou burne, and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the vvi hered barren tree that hath brought forth nothing but the thornes of greiuous ſinnes?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The 2. intention is, to ſatisfie in this life for my ſinnes, and to embrace willingly whatſoeuer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, and afflictions, ſeeing they are all as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of theſe other. For that which is ſuffered in this life is but litle, and for a little
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:178461:182"/>time, and is very proffitable to encreaſe in vertue, and to meritte augmentation of grace, and glorye: But in purgatory much is ſuffered, and vnproffitably for the endes before ſaide. And therefore I am to beeſeeche our Lorde, that if I shall bee careleſſe of this payment, it will pleaſe him to purifie mee with the fier of afflictions, that I may pay here with gaine that which I shall afterwardes pay without gaine. <hi>O my Sauiour that didſt promiſe to purifie the ſonnes of thy churche, as golde, and ſiluer is purified in the fier,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>The 3. intention is, to auoide as much as poſſibly I may veniall ſinnes:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.</note> ſeeing (as the Apoſtle ſaieth) they are no other thing, but wood, hay, and ſtubble to make fewell for the ſier that shall burne mee in purgatorye. The which is a greate rashneſſe if I haue the eyes of faithe to beholde it; for if I should ſee a man cut wood from a mountaine, and carry it to his houſe, and asking him wherefore hee carryed that wood, he should aunſwere mee, that it was to kindle a fier wherein to burne himſelfe, should not I holde him for a mad man? then am not I much more madde, doing things with ſo greate pleaſure,
<note place="margin">Colloquie Ex D.

Bevvare thou minglest not vvith them vvorkes that shall perishe, the vvood of auarice, the haye of ſenſuallitie, and the stubble of vanitie, louing vvith ſome diſorder the goods of this life: for this shall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee ſevvell for the ſier that shall burne thee in the life to come. O good Ieſus, deliuer mee from ſuch madneſſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing mee from theſe ſinnes by thy grace.</hi>

                        <head>The fourth Pointe.</head>
                        <p>FOurthly, I am to conſider two notable things that are in the ſoules of purgatorie. The firſt is, the greate reſignation that they haue in the will of God, as touching the greateneſſe, and contina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce of their paines: and the greate patience whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith they ſuffer, and accept their torments, beeing pleaſed that God is iuſt and chaſtizeth them according to their merits: and that hee purifieth them in that fiery fornace, that beeing refined they may enter into heauen. From whence I will learne, to haue patience in my afflictions, if I deſier they should bee my purgatorie, and not my hell: ſeeing the leſſer they are, the more proffitable they are to pay my debtes with all, and are contriued by Gods iuſtice to that ende. And ſeeing what ſoeuer is in God, is to bee loued, if I loue him in deede, I am to rejoice that hee is a iuſticer,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16.</note> and that hee hath a place appointed to chaſtize my ſinne, beeing as it is, ſo worthy of Chaſtizement.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, the greate deſier that theſe ſoules haue to bee ayded by the faithefull that liue vpon the earthe with ſacrifices, prayers, almes, faſtings, and other ſatisfactorie workes. As alſo with indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and other ſuffrages, to get out quickely from thoſe paines, and to goe to enioy God: which ought to mooue mee to fauour them, as much I may, though I take it from myſelfe to giue vnto them. For if I should ſee my freinde burne in a greate fier, and could get him out without burning myſelfe, or any other hurt, it were a greate crueltie not to get him out. Then if by faithe, I ſee theſe ſoules burne in ſuch a terrible fier, and may deliuer them with maſſes, Indulgences, and other good workes, it will bee a greate charitie to bee carefull heerein. And if what I would for myſelfe, I am to will for
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:178461:183"/>my neighbour, it is iuſt to doe what I may to deliuer him that paineth in purgatorie, as I would that others should doe for mee when I am there.

Greg. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. c.</hi> 57.</note> Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for that with this care, I make myſelfe worthy that God should then inſpire others to ayde mee: for the mercifull shall obtaine mercie in that kinde wherein they themſelues vſed it. And theſe very ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les when they come to beholde God, are very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull to thoſe that fauored them in their afflictions and will solicite the fauour of God for vs in ours, And all bee it I take from my ſelfe the ſatisfaction, of the worke that I apply to the deade: yet in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it for almes, I augment the merit, for charitie increaſeth by taking from myſelfe that I had neede of, to ſuccour the needy. For all theſe reaſons the holy ſcripture ſaieth, that it is a holy,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi> 12.46.</note> and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious care to pay for the deade, that the paines of their ſinnes may bee pardoned them: for of this care followe thoſe benefits that haue beene declared, to thoſe that pray for them.</p>

<note place="margin">Sic Deus dilexit mundum.</note> I am to conſider the infinite Greateneſſe of the Perſon that loued vs, and did vs this ſoueraigne benefit, and the infinite Baſeneſſe of him that is loued, and to whome this fauour
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:178461:208"/>is donne, comparing the one with the other. Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I will ponder, how the Originall of this ſoueraigne benefit was the infinite Charitye, and Loue of God; who as touching his owne Proffit, and Bleſſedneſſe, had no neede to loue any bodye but himſelfe: for with only beholding, and louing himſelfe, hee is infinitely bleſſed. Yet for all this, of meere Grace hee would loue the Creatures, and doe good to them; only becauſe hee is Good, and to demonſtrate in them the Riches of his Bountye: according to that of the <hi>Apostle: God which is riche in mercye,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4</note> 
                           <hi>for his exceeding Charitye loued vs:</hi> that is to ſay: Hee loued vs, not becauſe hee had neede of vs, nor becauſe wee of right did merit it: but only for that his Mercye was compaſſionate of our miſerye: and his Charitye would needes breake forth from him to loue others.</p>
                        <p>Secondly I will ponder,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how Gods infinite Charitye paſſed yet farther, in deſiring ſo to loue the Worlde, hee beeing who hee is. I call the Worlde the multitude of ſinfull men, that ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> contracting from him the foule ſpot of Originall ſinne, and afterwarde thorough their owne Will fell into moſt greivous, and actuall Sinnes, by the which they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt vnwoorthy to bee loued, &amp; deſerued to bee very much abhorred. In ſo much that God not only loued men when they were not, and ſo conſequently were neither Freindes, nor Enemyes: but hee loued them alſo when they were Enemyes, Rebells, and Vnthankefull for other innumerable Benefits that hee had donne them, to diſcouer heerein the infinite Treaſures of his Mercye, and Charitye.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I will make compariſon betweene that which God doeth in Heauen, and that which men doe vpon Earthe: pondering how God loueth the Worlde, that abhorreth him; and how the Worlde abhorreth God, that loueth it. The Worlde employeth itſelfe in offending God: and God deſireth to employ himſelfe in benefitting the Worlde: admiring therefore with myſelfe at the abhominable Wickedneſſe of the Worlde, and at the infinite Bountye, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye of God.</p>

                        <p>FOurthly, I am to conſider,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of our B. LADYE</note> how the time beeing come, wherein God would make himſelfe man; to laye the firſt Stone of this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hee created the B. Virgin that was to bee his mother: and in the very inſtant of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, hee communicated vnto her moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces, and ſingular Priuiledges, as was meete for ſuch a Sonne, to giue vnto his Mother, hauing choſen her thorough his owne Will, and thorough his greate Charitye, and beeing moſt Riche, and Potent to inriche her with the Treaſures of his Grace. Theſe Priuiledges wee will reduce vnto foure, pondering breifely ſome Reaſons thereof, and in what manner wee may participate of them.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Priuiledge hee graunted her,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was to preſerue her from Originall Sinne, into which by beeing the daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhee was to fall, ſanctifying her Soule in the firſt inſtant of her Creation, when hee joyned it to the bodye. So that like as God our Lord at one inſtant gaue to the Sun Beeing, and Light, and to the Angells, and to our firſt Parents <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eua,</hi> hee gaue jointely nature, and Grace: So in one, and the ſame inſtant, hee created, and ſanctifyed the Soule of the B. Virgin, electing it as the Sun, that it might not bee touched by the darkeneſſe of Sinne. The reaſon heereof (beſide what hath beene ſaide in the precedent Pointe, was for that our Sauiour Chriſt came into the Worlde,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:178461:215"/>to redeeme men, and to free them from all Sinne, eſpecially from Originall. The which hee might doe in two ſortes: either by drawing them out of Sinne, after they were fallen into it: or by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing them from falling into it. And this ſecond manner is much more excellent: for in it is moſt reſplendent the Omnipotencye, and Mercye of the Redeemer,

From hence it is, that for the Glorye of the Redeemer, and of his Redemption, it was very conuenient to vſe this mercye towardes her, that was to bee his mother, redeeming her with the beſt manner of Redemption, that was poſſible: preſeruing her from the Infamye, and Miſerye of Originall Sinne, at ſuch time as ſhee was to fall into it; honoring, and beautifying her with his Grace, that the mother might bee like vnto the Sonne in Puritye, they beeing both conceiued without Sinne: hee by Right, and ſhee by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge: hee as the Redeemer of the Worlde, and ſhee as his Coadjutrice in the worke of the Redemption.</p>

                        <p>THirdly,
<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> I am to conſider, how the bleſſed VIRGIN beeing but of ſmall age, (as it is thought of three yeares) by Gods inſpiration, was by her Parents preſented in the Temple, that ſhee might there bee dedicated, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in his diuine ſeruice, with other Damoſells that had made the like Profeſſion. Concerning this Preſentation, wee are to fixe our eyes vpon three Perſons interpoſed therein.</p>
                        <p>The firſt was the Maieſtye of God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who elected this bleſſed Childe, and inſpired in her this her retiring into the Temple, demonſtrating his Fatherly prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce towardes her, in drawing her from the noiſe, and trafficks of the Worlde, and attracting her to his howſe, and Temple, for that ſhee was to bee the House where hee would bee incarnate, and the liuing Temple where hee himſelfe would liue. And therefore with greate loue hee ſaide vnto her Hearte thoſe wordes of the <hi>Pſalme:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.11.</note> 
                           <hi>Heare ô Daughter, and ſee, and incline thyne eare, and forget thy People and the Howſe of thy father, and the king will couet thy Beautye.</hi> The bleſſed VIRGIN hearkened to this Voice, and Inſpiration of God, ſhee ſawe the fauour that heerein was donne her; ſhee inclined her Eare ſpeedily to obey what was commanded: ſhee wholely forgot her People, and renounced the howſe of her terreſtriall Father, to acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:178461:219"/>herſelfe to the good liking of her ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Father, who called her his Daughter. And ſo much increaſed her beautye with this newe Obedience, and Humillitye, that the king of Heauen, and of Earthe, caſt his Affection vpon her, and reioiced for hauing elected her to bee his mother. From hence will I collect, how greate a fauour God doeth to him, whome hee effectually inſpireth, and withdraweth from the Occaſions, and Perills of the Worlde, making him to abandon his Countrey, and the Houſe of his Father for his ſeruice: and how greate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wee all haue to bee obedient to ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration when wee perceiue it: ſeeing it is a true ſigne that God loueth vs, as his well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Children,

                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may bee pondered the Deuotion of <hi>S. Ioachim,</hi> and <hi>S. Anne</hi> the Parents of the bleſſed VIRGIN: who as holy people not only diuerted not the good deſiers of their daughter, but tooke her by the hande, and mooued by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God himſelfe, offered vnto him the only fruite of their wombe, retourning vnto him, what hee had giuen them, eſteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues happye, that God might bee ſerued by their daughter, and depriuing themſelues of her to giue her vnto him. And this they did with no leſſe ſpirit,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 1 24.</note> then <hi>Anna</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuell</hi> offered her ſonne vnto God, becauſe they knewe how acceptable this offering would bee to him. From whence I may alſo learne to offer vnto God with ſpirit and feruour, the onlie and beſt beloued daughter of my ſoule, which is <hi>Libertye:</hi> &amp; the principall of her Affections which is <hi>Loue,</hi>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:178461:220"/>with de termination to will nothing, but what hee willeth; and to loue only what hee loueth, offering myſelfe to giue him what ſoeuer hee ſhall aske mee.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I will ponder the Deuotion of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> herſelfe in this Preſentation, For her parents had no ſooner tolde her, that they would carrye her to the Temple but shee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with ioye saying that of the Prophet <hi>Dauid.</hi>

                           <hi>I reioiced in thoſe things that were saide vnto mee, we shall goe into the Houſe of our Lorde.</hi> But in arriuing at the Temple,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ezech.</hi> 40.6.</note> shee began to mount the fifteene degrees or ſteps with greate feruour of ſpirit, reſoluing to aſcende by all the degrees of Vertue vnto the higheſt toppe of Perfection,

                              <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 83.6.</note> full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling that of the Prophet <hi>Dauid. Bleſſed is the man whoſe helpe is from thee: he hath diſpoſed aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> &amp; increaſes <hi>in his hearte in the valle of tears, in the place which</hi> to this end, <hi>he hath appointed. They shall ascende from Vertue to Vertue, the God of Gods shall be ſeene in Sion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O manlike;</hi>

                              <hi>Colloquie Pſal.</hi> 45.6.</note> 
                           <hi>and bleſſed Babe, whome God fauoured with his ayde, and to aſſiſt whome, hee was earely vp in the morning, what zealous reſolutions makest thou in thy Hearte! and how well doſt thou dispoſe the Augmentation of Vertue in this place which thou haſt choſen for thy habitation!

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:178461:220"/>much as lay in her) to ſerue him all her Life in his holy Temple. O how was allmighty God pleaſed with this Offering! With what pleaſure might hee accept it, and what Thankes, and Giftes might hee retourne vnto her! The VIRGIN might ſay: <hi>Beholde mee heere, o Lord, I am come into thy houſe to bee thy perpetuall ſlaue: receiue mee into thy ſeruice: for I deſire no other Lot more glorious, then to ſerue thee:</hi> To this our Lord might aunſwere within her hearte: <hi>Come my Spouſe, enter into my garden:</hi>

                        <p>THirdly, I am to conſider, why our Lord deferred his comming into the Worlde, ſo many thouſands of yeares, pondering eſpecially two cauſes for my owne proffit.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is, for that in this time men by the Experience of their Innumerable, and moſt greiuous Sinnes, knewe the extreeme neceſſitye that they had of their Redeemer. Who as hee came from Heauen to bee the Phiſition of our Greiuances, hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they might increaſe, and bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, that his Infinite Wiſdome, and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencye might likewiſe bee manifeſted, in curing ſo greiuous Infirmities with ſo proportioned Remedyes. For this cauſe when Pride was growne to that exceſſiue heighth in the Worlde, that man would vſurpe the Greateneſſe of God, then would God take the forme of a man, to cure ſo abhominable Pride, with ſo profounde
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:178461:228"/>Humillitye. And when the Deſier of Riches, Honours, and Delicacyes was moſt egre, and hot; then would God clothe himſelfe with Pouertye, Contempt, and Dolour, to cure ſuch an ardent Deſier of temporall Goods, with ſo ardent a Contempt of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O ſoueraigne Phiſition,</hi>

                           <hi>I humbly thanke thee, for hauing come in ſuch a ſeaſon to cure our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with ſuch precious Medicines.

                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond cauſe of this delaye was,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for that it is the good Pleaſure of our Lord, that his Giftes, eſpecially when they are very greate, ſhould bee eſteemed, required, and ſolicited with Praiers, and Gronings: as did all this time the Fathers that were in <hi>Lymbo,</hi> and the Reighteous that liued on the Earthe. And by the waye likewiſe with this deferring, hee made proofe of the Confidence, and Patience of the Iuſt to whome this promiſe was made: for it is an Heroicall Vertue not to looſe Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.</note> though the accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe bee long time deferred. Whereupon ſaide a <hi>Prophet:</hi>

                           <hi>Yf hee ſhall made tariance expect him: becauſe comming hee will come, and will not ſlacke,</hi> that is: Though hee delaye according to the Deſier of thy Hearte, hee will not delaye according to the Order of his diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to accompliſh what thy neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: for hee will come infallibly in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time, when his Comming ſhall much more auaile thee.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two Cauſes I am to applye to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, pondering how God our Lord ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I will ponder what fullneſſe this is, and how the bleſſed VIRGIN was full of Grace with all manner of fullneſſe.

                           <p>Her memory was full of holy Cogitations:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Shee ſhewed her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Chaſtitye,

O happy, &amp; a thouſand times happy is that Soule that findeth Grace with God!

And therefore to be borne, he diſpoſed how to get out of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to leaue thoſe commodities that he might haue had, beeing borne in the houſe of his mother, and among his kinred, and freindes, where he could not haue wanted the ſhelter of ſome warme lodging, and couerture, beſides ſome daintineſſe for his nouriſhment, which <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> failed not of, beeing borne in his fathers houſe.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:178461:280"/>of the king of Heauen from thoſe of the king of Earthe. For this his Edict was founded vpon Pride, Ambition, Arrogance, and Auarice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding more then he might doe; that is, that the whole worlde should be enrolled, as if all the worlde had beene his: and deſiring that all should profeſſe themſelues to be his Vaſſalls, and should pay him tribute were they neuer ſo poore, and needye. But contrarily the king of Heauen <hi>Christ</hi> IESVS, had all his cogitations placed in Humillitye, Pouertye, and Subjection: and in treading downe Pompes, Riches, and Vanities. He commeth not to commaunde, nor to be ſerued, but to obey, and ſerue the whole Worlde. And in confirmation heereof, he willeth that his mother, and he himſelfe in her, should be enrolled, and profeſſe themſelues to be the Vaſſalls of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and pay him tribute; to confounde by this his example the Pride, and Couetouſneſſe of the Worlde.

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13</note> and to be ſubject to euery humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his Loue?

O what content, and Ioye ſhe receiued at that firſt viewe, not ſtaying vpon the outward beautye of the bodye, but paſſing to the beautye of the Soule, and of the Deitye! On the one ſide ſhe embraced him, and kiſſed him louingly as her Sonne: &amp; on the other ſide ſhee ſhruncke backe, and humbly retired, conſidering that he was God: for with theſe two armes God deſireth to bee embraced; with Charitye, and Humilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye; with Loue, and Reuerence: and the like am I to doe ſpiritually, taking him as it were in my armes, louing him, and reuerencing him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to him with Loue, and retiring my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with Humillitye.</p>

And for this cauſe, among many names that he might haue giuen him, he would haue him called IESVS, which is to ſay, a <hi>Sauiour.</hi> For his comming into the Worlde was principally to ſaue vs, and this was his Office. And albeit others had this name, yet they were but figures, and shadowes of this Soueraigne Childe: who with full mouthe, and thorough his excellencye deſerueth to be called, IESVS, <hi>Sauiour,</hi> and <hi>Deliuerer</hi> not only of bodyes, but alſo of Soules, which he doeth with <hi>three</hi> admirable excellencyes.</p>

And as it ſeemed vnto him that he had no more to deſier, nor no more to ſee in this life, hauing ſeene the Sauiour, he conuerted all that was in him to glorifye God, and to praiſe him for this fauour, proteſting that now he ſhould dye in peace, whenſoeuer it was Gods pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:178461:317"/>ſaying with <hi>Dauid: In peace I will ſleepe,</hi>

Meditation runneth from one thing to another, ſeeking out bidden verities, as hitherto hath beene donne: but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation is a ſimple beholding of the Truthe without varietye of Diſcourſe, with greate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Admiration, and Loue: and as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it is obtained after meditation, ſo after we haue meditated theſe myſteries of our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it shall not be amiſſe to runne ouer eache of them againe with this manner of affectuous Contemplation, which wee call Application of the faculties: for as the exteriour faculties doe very breifely without the windings of diſcourſes perceiue their objects, and are delighted, and pleaſed in them: ſo in this Contemplation, the interiour ſenſes of the Soule (which are her owne interiour faculties with the variety of their Actes) without newe diſcourſes, preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe which haue beene donne at other times, per ceiue theſe Verities, and collect from thence meruailous affections of Deuotion, our

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I may likewiſe conſider diuerſe ſortes of men that begin to ſerue God, either in their Childehood, or in ſome other parte of their Age.

                        <p>Heere I am to ponder, who it is that obeyeth, and ſubjecteth himſelfe, and to whome, in what thinges,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and in what manner. He that obeyeth is God, Infinite, the Creatour, and ſupreame Gouernour of the Worlde, vnto whome all are obliged to obey, and to be ſubject. And albeit it was not much, that as man he should obey his eternall Father, yet it is admirable, that he should ſubiect himſelfe to obey his mother, and a poore Artificer; the Creator ſubiecting himſelfe to the Creatures, the Lord to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, and the king to his Vaſſalls: wherewith I may confounde my owne Pride, and Rebellion; <hi>O vile VVorme,</hi>

                           <hi>why doest not thou ſubiect thyſelfe to man for God, ſeeing God ſubiecteth himſelfe to man for thee? If God obeyeth the voice of a man, why doest not thou wretched man obey the voice of God? O Sun of Iustice, that mouedst thyſelfe, and ſtayedst at the voice of theſe two men, to whome for my Loue thou diddest ſubiect thyſelfe, graunt me that I may ſubiect myſelfe to thoſe whome thou hast left me in thy place, delighting to denye my owne will, to accompliſh theirs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then will I ponder the things wherein he obeyed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that is to ſay; in ſuch baſe things as are vſed to be donne in the houſe of a poore Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, and in that manner that Children vſe to ſerue in the houſe of their Parents, when they are poore. And this did our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> with greate Humillitye, and Punctuallitye, with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous promptneſſe, and alacritye, and with all that perfection that perfect Obedience requireth: the which equally embraceth greate, and litle; eaſy, and difficult, honorable, and contemptible. For ſeeing that God himſelfe humbled himſelfe to be obedient in things that were ſo baſe, all
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:178461:347"/>things in is eſtimation are very high, and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nothing baſe in the houſe of God, if he commaundeth it: for if God commaundeth, it is ſufficient to make honorable the execution thereof, as <hi>S. Raphael</hi> helde it for an high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſerue <hi>Tobias</hi> in things very baſe,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Tob.</hi> 5.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.</note> becauſe God commaunded it. From whence I will col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that the excellencye of ſpirituall Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not ſo much in doing workes of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues very glorious, ſuch as are: to preache, to gouerne, to teache; as in doing thoſe workes that God commaundeth, though of themſelues they be baſe, but yet after an excellent manner: that is; with much Loue of God, with a pure Intention of his glorye, with greate promptneſſe, and alacritye of Hearte, and with a feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier in all theſe things to pleaſe him. And in this ſence it is that the <hi>VViſeman</hi> ſayeth;
<note place="margin">

And ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, as touching the manner of working with a ſpirit of Sanctitye, was no leſſe excellent in the worke of ſawing, then in the worke of preaching, or doing ſome miracle. And our bleſſed LADYE the VIRGIN ſhewed no leſſe the excellencye of her Sanctitye when ſhe ſpun, then when ſhe ſerued her Sonne, or ſuffered any thing for his ſake. And heerein I am to imitate our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his bleſſed mother, if by the ſhorteſt waye I would attaine to greateſt perfection.</p>
